## Description
A game by the Blind Dingoes, 'The Prisoner' is a game designed to change the idea standard RPG fighting systems
from a menu driven experience to more engaging styles by adding a new game with a beat 'em up style!

The main plan for this significant change to the genre is to remove the mash the 'a' button mentality and replace
it with an invigorating fighting game, integrated into the RPG in the exact same way as the existing battle system.
